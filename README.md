# Prediction of the Ultimate Playing 11

Welcome to the "Prediction of the Ultimate Playing 11" GitHub repository, where we delve into the exhilarating world of T20 cricket, conducting a comprehensive analysis of data from the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022. Leveraging web scraping techniques via the Bright Data proxy network, we extract crucial cricket data, encompassing batting summaries, bowling summaries, match results, and player information, directly from the ESPN server. This data is then meticulously processed and manipulated using essential Python modules and libraries, such as pandas and json, to ensure its proper organization and structure for further analysis.

Our repository showcases seamless integration with Microsoft Power BI, where the processed datasets are imported, allowing us to establish intricate connections between different data sets. Utilizing the full potential of Power BI, we create dynamic dashboards featuring interactive visualizations and insightful reports. The players are meticulously categorized into specific roles, including Power Hitters, Anchors (Middle Order), Finishers, All-Rounders, and Specialist Fast Bowlers.

Through the powerful data analytics capabilities of Power BI, we employ specific criteria for each batting and bowling position, even considering the left-right combination while batting. This analysis enables us to make informed predictions and estimate the ultimate playing 11 for the highly anticipated T20 Cricket World Cup 2022.
